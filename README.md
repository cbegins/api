**Roadmap for Building AI Proxy API Platform (Begins)**

**Objective**
Build a scalable, professional-grade AI API gateway platform that allows users to access Gemini AI via your own secure proxy API. This platform will support multiple Gemini API keys, enforce user-level rate limits, provide clean developer-facing documentation, and offer a refined, high-performance user experience. The long-term goal is to grow this into a company-grade product with monetization, advanced features, and reliable infrastructure.

**Phase 1: Foundation and Strategic Planning**

1.1 Define Value Proposition

* Product Offering: A public-facing API that provides instant access to Gemini-based AI functionality without requiring users to obtain or manage their own API keys.
* User Benefit: No registration with Google, no API configuration needed—just an easy-to-use AI interface for devs and non-devs.
* Target Audience: Indie developers, hobbyists, students, startups, and small-scale builders seeking an accessible and free AI interface.

1.2 Brand Strategy

* Name: Finalize product name (e.g., Begins).
* Domain: Secure primary domains such as api.begins.site and [www.begins.site](http://www.begins.site).
* Brand Voice: Clean, minimal, elite, and design-forward.

**Phase 2: Design System**

2.1 Landing Website Design
**Prompt:** Design a fully responsive homepage for an AI platform called “Begins.” The website must use a 100% white background with black typography only—no icons, colors, or decorative elements. Use only one of these two fonts: Satoshi or Inter. Headlines should be large and bold, and all text should be left-aligned for desktop and center-aligned on mobile. The layout must be ultra-minimalist and convey a premium tech startup feel, similar to Stripe, Linear, or Apple.

**Required Sections:**

* Hero section with product headline, 1-paragraph value explanation, and one CTA button (“Get Free API Key”).
* Feature list with three simple items (e.g., no Google setup, instant key usage, smart routing).
* Live API usage counter displayed with dynamic update animation.
* CTA section encouraging users to try the API.
* Footer with terms, privacy, and company info.

**Interactions & Effects:**

* Text fades and slides in softly as user scrolls.
* Use subtle padding and spacing—no borders or UI containers.
* On mobile, all sections must stack vertically, scale fonts proportionally, and support touch gestures.

**Phase 3: Backend Infrastructure**

3.1 Core Backend Architecture
**Prompt:** Create a proxy API that exposes your own endpoint while internally routing requests to Gemini via Google’s API. Users will not see the Gemini key or endpoint. The system should auto-rotate keys, rate-limit users, and scale efficiently.

**Tech Stack:**

* Node.js (with Express or Fastify) or Python (with FastAPI)
* Redis (for in-memory tracking and quota)
* PostgreSQL or Supabase (for persistent storage)
* Optional: Firebase (for lightweight user tracking or auth)

**Backend Components:**

* API Key Issuer: Issues unique Begins API keys and stores them securely.
* Proxy Handler: Accepts requests with user prompts, picks a valid Gemini key, and forwards the request.
* Key Rotation Engine: Checks quota for each Gemini key and rotates if limits are hit.
* Usage Tracker: Tracks tokens per user and per Gemini key daily.
* Rate Limiter: Enforces per-user, per-IP request caps.
* Abuse Protection: Blocks bad actors and detects spam.
* Admin Panel (optional): Manage keys, ban users, and track system health.

**Request Flow:**

* User sends prompt to: `POST https://api.begins.site/v1/chat` with their `begins-api-key`.
* Backend validates key, rate limit, and usage.
* Selects Gemini key, sends request, and returns formatted response.

**Phase 4: Documentation Platform**

4.1 Developer Docs Design
**Prompt:** Build a professional documentation site using only black text on white background, no icons or color. Use vertical navigation on the left and documentation content on the right. Typography must be clean using Satoshi or Inter. Content should slide/fade in softly as the user navigates.

**Sections:**

* Getting Started
* API Key Authentication
* Request and Response Format
* Rate Limiting
* Error Codes and Handling
* Billing and Plans (future)

**Code Samples:**
Must include usage in:

* `curl`
* JavaScript (fetch)
* Python (requests)

Ensure Begins API endpoints are shown (not Gemini’s).

---

**Phase 5: Monetization Strategy**

5.1 Free Tier

* Default: 100 requests/day per Begins API key
* Key issued on first visit or via email

5.2 Paid Plans

* ₹10/week = 2,000 requests
* ₹99/month = Unlimited requests with rate cap
* Stripe for billing

5.3 Enterprise

* Custom plan inquiry form for startups or dev tools
* Optional: User-provided Gemini key passthrough mode

---

**Phase 6: Analytics and Abuse Prevention**

6.1 Dashboard

* Real-time stats: total requests, tokens, top users
* Filter by API key, time period, and endpoint

6.2 Abuse Defense

* IP rate limit, key-level quota, bot detection
* Blacklist prompt keywords or patterns
* Alert on suspicious spikes or token misuse

6.3 Auto Key Management

* Detect when Gemini key quota hits limit
* Rotate to backup key seamlessly
* Alert system for expired or banned keys

---

**Phase 7: QA and Testing**

7.1 Automated Testing

* Unit and integration tests for backend proxy and quota handling
* Failover tests for expired keys

7.2 Manual Testing

* UI and docs on all screen sizes
* Rate limit edge cases
* Concurrency and traffic spikes simulation

---

**Phase 8: Launch and Promotion**

8.1 Pre-Launch

* Simple waitlist site
* Soft outreach on Discord and Twitter
* Developer community preview

8.2 Launch

* Product Hunt launch
* Medium post or blog launch article
* Give unlimited API to first 100 users

---

**Post-MVP Features**

* Public chat UI using your proxy
* User analytics + token usage
* Embedded chatbot widgets
* Browser extension or minimal desktop client

---

**Next Steps:**
Begin parallel development of backend (Phase 3) and homepage (Phase 2). Request implementation help as needed.
